    "# What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical is a discipline that uses data to support claims about populations. These \"populations\" are what we refer to as \"distribution\". Most statistical analysis is based on probability, which is why these pieces are usually presented together. More often than not, you'll see courses labeled \"Intro to Probability and Statistics\" rather than separate intro to probability and into to statistics courses. This is because probability is the study of random events, or the study of how likely it is that some event will happen.\n",

    "# Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, statistics is splite into two subfields: descriptive and inferential. The difference is subtle, but important. Descriptive statistics refer to the portion of statistics dedicated to summarizing a total population. Inferential Statistics, on the other hand, allows us to make inferences of a population from its subpopulation. Unlike descriptive statistics, inferential statistics are never 100% accurate because its calculations are measured without the total population.\n",

    "# Descriptive Statistics \n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, to review, descriptive statistics refers to the statistical tools used to summarize a dataset. One of the frist operations often used to get a sense of what a given data looks like is the mean operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "You know what the mean is, you've heard it every time your computer science professor handed your midterms back and announced that the average, or mean, was a disappointing low of 59. Woops. With the said, the \"average\" is just one of many summary statistics you might choose to describe the typical value of the center tendency of a sample. You can find the formal mathematical definition below. Note that ùúá is  the symbol we use for mean. all text Computing the mean isn't fun task, especially if you have hundreds, even thousands or millions of data points to compute the mean for. You definitely don't want to do this by hand, Right. In Python, you can either implement your own mean function, or you can use NumPy.\n",
